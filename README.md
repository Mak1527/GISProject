# GISProject

A curated collection of geospatial analysis scripts and workflows developed using both Google Earth Engine (GEE) JavaScript API and Python. This repository serves as a central portfolio for various GIS, remote sensing, and spatial data processing projects.

## Repository Structure
GISProject/
├── GEE/ # Google Earth Engine JavaScript codes

## Contents

- **GEE/** – Scripts for cloud-based remote sensing analysis, burn severity mapping, land cover classification, and more using the GEE platform.
- **Python/** – Scripts and notebooks for spatial data processing, raster/vector manipulation, and machine learning using libraries such as GeoPandas, rasterio, and scikit-learn.

## How to Use

1. **Browse the Folders:**  
   - Navigate to the `GEE` folder for Earth Engine (JavaScript) scripts.
   - Navigate to the `Python` folder for Python-based geospatial analysis.

2. **Project Readmes:**  
   - Each major project or code collection contains its own `README.md` with a project description, usage instructions, and references.

3. **Run the Scripts:**
   - For GEE scripts: Copy the code into your [Google Earth Engine Code Editor](https://code.earthengine.google.com/) account and follow the instructions in the project’s README.
   - For Python scripts: Set up a Python environment with the required libraries (instructions in each project folder), and run the script or notebook as described.

## Example Projects

- **GEE/Burn_Severity_SouthKorea/**  
  Burn severity analysis of the 2025 wildfire in South Korea using Sentinel-2 data.

- **Python/**  
(More projects coming soon!)
